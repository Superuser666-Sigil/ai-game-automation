# 📁 Sample Recordings

This directory will contain example training datasets once available.

## 🎯 Coming Soon

We're working on providing sample datasets for:
- **Simple puzzle games** (beginner-friendly)
- **Strategy games** (intermediate complexity)  
- **Action games** (advanced users)

## 📝 Format

Each sample dataset will include:
- `frames/` directory with screenshot images
- `actions.npy` file with recorded input data
- `README.md` with dataset details and metrics

## 🚀 How to Use

Once sample data is available:

1. **Download a dataset** to your main project directory
2. **Extract the files** so you have `frames/` and `actions.npy`
3. **Analyze the data**: `python scripts/4_analyze_data_quality.py`
4. **Train on the sample**: `python scripts/5_train_model.py`

## 🤝 Contributing Sample Data

Have a good training dataset? See our [Contributing Guide](../../docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to share it with the community!

## ⚠️ Legal Note

All sample datasets will be:
- From legally owned games
- Focused on gameplay mechanics (not story/assets)
- Properly documented and attributed
- Freely distributable
